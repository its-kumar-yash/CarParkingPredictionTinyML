Description: In this, you need to find the Car Park Distance Prediction for Smart Vehicles. Most of the parking lots around the world make sure that the cars are parked in parallel. However many people face difficulties when it comes to parallel parking, especially due to various assumptions one has to make regarding spatial arrangements. A machine learning algorithm needs to be implemented to calculate whether the car would be able to successfully park in the cavity or not, based on the distances measured by the sensor.
